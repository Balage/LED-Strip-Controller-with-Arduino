# LED Strip Controller with Arduino
The controller can drive an RGB LED strip which can be up to 25 meters long, using music as input. This can come from any device with a line level output (basically all PCs, mobile phones and Hi-Fi systems). It uses a visual equalizer which separates the audio into 3 channels: low, middle and high frequency, and each of these correspond to a specific color. The device also supports passive modes where no input is needed.

## How to install code
- Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- The Arduino IDE by default stores all Sketches in a folder named **"Arduino"** in your **Documents** folder.
- Download the repository and copy the entire **"LED_Strip_Controller"** folder to there.
- Start the Arduino IDE and select **"File"**, **"Sketches"**, and then choose **"LED_Strip_Controller"** from the list.
